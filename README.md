A mountain inspired watchface  A beautiful (imho) and functional watchface, showing a panoramic view of Mountains. The airplane represents the seconds, flying from left to right in one minute. I designed the watchface to be minimal, but still include all the function I need on a daily basis like the date and a seconds. 

The watchface includes bluetooth disconnect notification, by vibrating twice when the watch loses the connection and vibrating once when the phone is connected again.
